# This file lists all the resources I consulted and referenced throughout this project.
# (also just for my own good because I have terrible memories) 

~~ Special shoutout to Mike Taylor, our great 15-112 professor, for enduring my frustrated rants about TP and giving me multiple good ideas.

~~ Special shoutout to Matt Kong, my TP Mentor, for dealing with my disoriented late night emails and my wack schedules.

~~ Special shoutout to all my friends (112 or not) who helped me brainstorm a project idea, as well as encouraging me and helping me destress.
