--- Swimming Notes ---

Welcome to Swimming Notes, a platformer game where your goal is to collect all the music notes, while enjoying the complex melody.

# Preparing to run the project

This project requires Python 3 as well as Pygame to run. Use the command below to install Pygame for Python 3:

	pip3 install Pygame

This project also uses MIDI. If you do not hear any sounds while running the Tutorial level, you might need to install a virtual synthesizer.

For Mac OS, a simple and lightweight synthesizer like SimpleSynth would work.
